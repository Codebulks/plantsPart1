            Plants are the most significant gifts to humanity. They grow into huge trees or fully-grown plants with a lot of care. Plants help us with various fruits, vegetables, oxygen, etc. and maintain the balance in the ecosystem. Plants also include different types of organisms like bushes, herbs, vines, etc. Plants are inextricably linked to human existence on this planet. Plants are beneficial to us in a variety of ways. Plants offer seeds such as wheat, rice, corn, and other foods that we consume on a daily basis. Plants provide us with oxygen and take in the carbon dioxide that we release. This helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and reduces global warming. The effects of global warming are known to everyone, and therefore, there have been a lot of efforts and awareness programmes to plant more and more trees to reduce global warming. The plants grow into trees which bind the roots to the soil, which prevents soil erosion. They also absorb other harmful gasses from the atmosphere during the carbon dioxide process. They absorb harmful emissions and other pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by industry and cars, acting as sponges. Therefore, it is essential to plant more and more trees. We celebrate Vanmahotsav week and encourage planting more trees.

            That plant was the basis of traditional medicine is known from about 2600 B.C from Mesopotamia. Substances used were oils of Cedrus (cedar) and Cupresus sompevirens (cypress), Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice), Commiphora (myrrh) and Papaver somnifenm (opium poppy). All are still in use today for treatments of various ailments. Egyptian medicine dates from about 2900 B.C. Ebers Papyrus, the best known Egyptian pharmacopeia dating from 1500 B.C describes about 700 drugs, most of which are plant derived.


            The first record of Chinese Materia Medica contains 52 medicines and subsequent records contain 365 medicines and 850 medicines. Indian Ayurvedic system forms the basis of primary text of Tibetan Medicine.
            
            The Greeks contributed substantially to herbal drug development. Arabs preserved much of the Greco-Roman expertise and expanded it to include the use of their own resources, notably Chinese and Indian herbs unknown to the Greco-Roman world.

            Plant products are also important in health care for remaining 20% population in developing countries and for those in industrialized countries as well. Analysis of data in the United States from 1959 to 1980 indicates that about 25% prescription drugs contain plant extracts or active principles derived from plants.

            At least 119 chemical compounds derived from 90 plant species are important drugs currently in use in one or more countries. Of these 119, 74% were discovered during attempts to isolate active chemicals from plant used in traditicual medicines. Examples of Sudi plant based drugs in current use are given below based on a WHO document.
